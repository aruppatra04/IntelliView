## Overview  
IntelliView is a full-stack web application designed to convert raw data into actionable insights—featuring a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites  
- **Node.js** (v14 or above)  
- **npm** or **yarn**  
- Optional: **MongoDB** if included or desired  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aruppatra04/IntelliView.git
   cd IntelliView
   ```

2. Install dependencies in each part:  
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:  
   Place a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder with variables such as:  
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri_here
   ```

4. Start frontend and backend:  
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start         # or yarn start
   cd ../frontend
   npm start         # runs React app on http://localhost:3000
   ```

---

## Usage  
1. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`    
2. Interact with the web UI powered by React  
3. Backend APIs (for data ingestion, analytics, insight generation) are exposed at `http://localhost:5000/api/*`  

---

## Testing  
- Backend:  
  ```bash
  cd backend
  npm test
  ```  
- Frontend:  
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm test
  ```
